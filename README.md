Gene-IE – ML-Powered Genomic Analysis Tool

🚀 Built at HackRare’25 | Harvard University

Overview

30 Hours. Zero Sleep. One Crazy Idea.

Gene-IE is a machine learning-powered genomic analysis tool designed to predict pathogenic mutations and aid in early rare disease detection. Developed at HackRare’25, this project integrates Reactome, UniProt, and ClinGen to classify mutation severity and provide insights into high-risk genetic variations.

🏆 What We Built

Integrated Reactome API, UniProt, and ClinGen to classify mutation severity.
Achieved 80% accuracy in identifying high-risk mutations using ML models.
Built everything from scratch—pure hustle, pure adrenaline!
